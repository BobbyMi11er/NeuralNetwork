C# Neural Network

This was a challenge I gave myself to learn more about C# (which I had never used before) as well as learn how neural networks function.<br>

This program uses the MNIST dataset (which can be found and downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv)). This is a commonly used dataset to test neural networks that features images of handwritten digits as well as tags that denote what digit was written.

I followed the [Coding Train's](https://github.com/CodingTrain) neural network [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ7HLz9VYz0&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aCibgK1PTWWu9by6XFdCfh&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain) playlist and translated the JavaScript to C#

I was also inspired by this project to write my IB HLII Math Internal Assesment on neural networks, which is linked [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wJOI9HiUroIXADv6o0Folv-Fyp-mee8J/view?usp=sharing).
